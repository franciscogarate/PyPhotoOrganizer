# PyPhotoOrganizer
Include geolocation info in your photos with Python and Perl.
Also, I include some useful scripts to organize them, depending on the size, camera maker or whatever you want if it's included in Exif info.

I hope the scripts are clear enough to be understood and customized for beginners python users.

Requirements:
- python 2.7 or 3
- perl
- library exiftools (perl)

Instructions:
- Images must be in a local folder
- Following variables must be completed:
        - path_w
        - typefile_w
        - size_w
